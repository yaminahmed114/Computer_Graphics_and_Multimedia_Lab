
# Setup

## 1.  Windows ##

   * ### Download glfw libray from https://www.glfw.org/download.html. Download *64-bit Windows binaries* from *Windows pre-compiled binaries*. ###  
   * ### Create **build** and **lib** folder in Code Repo. Put *glfw3.dll* from *lib-mingw-w64* folder of glfw library to **build** and **lib** folder.  ###
   * ### For C++ compiler and make, Download MSYS2 Package Manager from https://www.msys2.org/ . ###  
   * ### Run following commands in MSYS2 terminal: ```pacman -S base-devel``` and ```pacman -S gcc``` . ### 
   * ### add your bin folder (which includes g++.exe and make.exe) PATH (C:\msys64\usr\bin) of msys64 installation directory in your environment variable.
   * ### Run ```make win``` in Terminal. ###
   * ### ```.exe``` file will be in **build** folder. ###
   * ### if your code does not run, then you have to check openGL version by installing GLview from http://www.realtech-vr.com/home/glview . If your openGL version is below 3.3, then update windows. ###

🚀 Lab 02: Drawing Two Cyan Obtuse Triangles Using OpenGL
📋 Assignment Description
Develop an OpenGL application that renders two cyan-colored obtuse triangles positioned at two distant corners of the screen on an orange background. The program window must display the student’s full name as the title and should terminate when the user presses the first letter of their name on the keyboard.

✅ Requirements Fulfilled
✅ Created a dedicated GitHub repository for CGM course
✅ Orange background window (RGB: 1.0, 0.5, 0.0)
✅ Two cyan-colored obtuse triangles rendered using OpenGL
✅ Triangles positioned at top-left and bottom-right corners
✅ Window title displays student’s full name
✅ Window closes when the initial letter of the name is pressed
✅ Used GLFW + GLAD (Modern OpenGL Core Profile)
✅ Proper code structure, formatting, and comments
✅ Original work implemented and tested locally
✅ README documentation and output screenshot attached
